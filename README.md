ACCESSIBILITY PROJECT

1. Before you get started, please download the Screen Reader extensionon Google Chrome -
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en.
Click on the Screen Reader extension button on the top right corner of your Chrome browser and then click on Options.
Find the settings that says "Toggle ChromeVox active or inactive." Change the keyboard command to Shift+A so that
it is easier for you to turn on and off the Screen Reader.

2. Read through the code and modify it so that you have a final version that works properly with the screen reader on.
Ensure that the keyboard navigation feature works properly as well in the right order. Furthermore, use decriptive text
alternatives for media contents.
